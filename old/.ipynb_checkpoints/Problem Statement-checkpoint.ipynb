    "### Problem Characteristics and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* There exists a set of contracts that the fleet must serve in a certain planning horizon. This set is completely known at the beginning of the horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each contract is characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * a single trip or cargo\n",
    "\n",
    "    * an origin-destination pair of ports\n",
    "\n",
    "    * time windows for both picking and delivering the cargo. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A ship can serve at most one contract at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fleet is non-homogeneous. Ship capacity, navigation speeds, fuel consumption, cost parameters etc are all ship dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Due to cargo-ship or ship-port incompatibilities not all ships can serve all contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two cargoes may be incompatible with each other, meaning that corresponding trips cannot be done consecutively by the same ship, unless a time delay (e.g. for cleaning) or a third trip is placed between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Navigation speed is a controllable variable. Since fuel consumption depends on navigation speed, controlling the speed impacts not only travel time, but also travel costs. Since navigation speed affects fuel consumption, it also determines CO2 emissions and ultimately the Carbon Intensity Indicator. In the paper *Ronen D (1993) Ship scheduling: the last decade* **fuel consumption is approximately a cubic function of speed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Income from each contract is fixed, so net profit is maximized by minimizing total relevant costs. Relevant costs are mainly operating costs, but may also include other kinds of costs as long as they can be associated with each individual trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is important to notice that given a sequence of cargoes to be served by a single ship, a ballast or empty trip must take place from the delivery port of each cargo to the origin of the next cargo in the sequence, unless these two ports coincide. **These ballast trips represent a singificant portion of total avoidable cost.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem consists of : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deciding the set of cargoes to be served by each ship;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determining the time of arrival at a port;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determining the time of departure from a port;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Determining the waiting times at each port;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Determining the navigation speed at each trip;\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective** is to serve all cargoes while minimizing the total relevant operating costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating costs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fuel Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "* Port and Custom Expenses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tolls paid at canals (Suez and Panama)\n",

    "The authors say that **the cost parameters for each potential arc have to be determined outside the model, beforehand, probably by using another optimization model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then they should be used as inputs to this model. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if navigation speed is considered, the cost parameter of an arc must reflect the minimum achievable cost over all feasible speed combinations on the contracted trip and the ballast trip associated with the arc. This minimization, however, should be performed by an external model whose output (the arc cost) enters as a constant for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, more than one arc can represent the same pair of trips. These arcs differ on the starting times (nodes) for each trip, which imply that minimum cost may be achieved at different speeds for different arcs. So when selecting the arcs that constitute a route, the model is implicitly optimizing the navigation speed for each leg of the route. \n",
